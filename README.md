Minimal configs and folders to start BEM project
================================================

### Usage

    › git clone git://github.com/bem/project-stub.git
    › cd project-stub
    › make

This will install localy all project's dependencies from npm and starts local `bem server`
under HTTP port `8080`. So you could navigate to `http://localhost:8080/desktop.bundles/index/index.html`.

Alternative to use `make`, you could install all dependencies by your self. To do so type `npm install` from the top
of your working copy. After that your could start server:

    › bem server

    Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/desktop.bundles/index/index.html`

**NOTE:** `bem` should be in your `PATH` environment variable. You could do this by adding this line to your user's
`.profile` config:

    exports PATH=./node_modules/.bin:$PATH
